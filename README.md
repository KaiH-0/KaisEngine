# KaisEngine
A game engine that was made entirely with Java, this doesn't use any dependencies except for the default java libraries. This can be quite hard to use but I have included an example project in there to show how easy it is to use. This was done in three months.

Features:
- No Offscreen Rendering
- Collision
- Alpha values on colours
- AABB Collision
- Lighting System
